    Due to the framework of the customers simulation environment, access permissions and limited usablity, we experienced a great increase in scope. A key objectice
    was to create our own simulation environment to test our multi robotic path planning algorithms in. Our simulation environment seeks to mimic the customer simulation
    as close as possible.

    title: "Research and Implement Multi-Robot Path Planning Algorithms",

    We researched the cutting edge of multi-robot path planning algorithms to find solutions to best fit the customers needs. We then implemented them in our simulation environment
    to test their effectiveness against key, quantitative metrics.

    We optimized the robots path planning to reduce the time it takes to deliver packages. We did this by implemening cutting edge solutions to multi-robotic path planning algorithms.
    We hoped to implement local path replanning and obstacle avoidance, however due to changes a scope and impending deadlines we were not able to pursue these avenues.
